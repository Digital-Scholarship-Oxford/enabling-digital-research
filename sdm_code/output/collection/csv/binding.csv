The outlines of the catchplates are visible through the surface of the parchment. The right board contains two matching indentations for the corresponding catchplates, now lost. The parchment pastedowns also show evidence of prior clasps, with damage that aligns with the placement of the catchplates and vestiges of rust. The outline of metal corner fittings can be seen through the parchment on both boards, and a vertical row of six metal pins can be seen on the outer edge of the right board.The spine shows four raised double sewing supports with equal spacing. The sewing supports are laced through the boards in four holes, travel through an indented channel in the inner face of the board to two holes (forming a V shape), and exit to be plugged with a dowel or wedge.The shelfmark is embossed into a separate piece of red leather that has been adhered to the centre panel of the spine - possibly taken from a previous binding.

Ashmole 45,Ashmole,"Late seventeenth-century calf binding over pasteboards typical of Elias Ashmole's style, with embossed on the central spine panel. The spine is covered in a separate piece of leather from the boards, of the same colour, that extends under the board-covers. The head, tail, and panels of the spine display horizontal concentric tool framing. The spine shows four raised sewing supports covering thick cords which support all four composite parts - three of these cords are intact. The sewing stations do not follow any of the original sewing stations in the composite parts, which show evidence of between five and six stations from previous bindings. This is typical of Ashmole's binding style. However, the spine-cover has likely been replaced since the manuscript left Ashmole's collection. The typeset of the shelf mark is similar, but not identical, to Ashmole's typeset (varying in the height of letters and thickness of vertical strokes in characters and ), and Ashmole's embossed crest is missing from the second panel (see e.g. MS Ashmole 44). The board-covers also show evidence of having been lifted up at the spine-edge to allow for the spine-cover to be adhered beneath them.ASH. 45A4Due to the varying heights of the composite units, there are no endbands. The sewing supports are laced into the boards using shortened single-hole lacing without channels. The boards are cut according to the largest codicological unit, with wide squares. Both boards display concentric frame tooling which is flush with the border on three sides and inset from the spine-border by several centimeters, as is typical of Ashmole's bindings. The absence of the usual concentric frame tooling on the spine side is likely due to cropping of the leather when the new spine-cover was added. The board edges are tooled with a repeating zig-zag pattern typical of Ashmole's bindings. The inner rear board bears an inscription typical of the Bodleian's in-house bindery, with the initial and the date, partially obscured, . This is likely the work of A. G. Wintersgill, who was employed at the Bodleian for the finishing, furbishing, and repair of bindings from 1949, and whose initials can be seen on other Ashmole bindings (e.g. MS Ashmole 1431).

MS_Ashmole_46_binding_1,manuscript_351,MS_Ashmole_46,MS. Ashmole 46,Ashmole,"The binding is made of gilt punched leather, using the technique whereby repetitive patterns of geometrical shapes were punched onto the parts of the design that would be left unpainted. It has been coloured with a yellow-gold glaze or tinted varnish, and is decorated with abstract floral designs and a mixture of overlapping punch patterns. On this technique, see Posthuma De Boer, Martine, E. F. Koldeweij, and Roger M. Groves, Gilt Leather Artefacts (2016).The leather covers paste boards typical of the sixteenth century, and shows remnants of two metal clasps with flower motif pins, which were once attached to leather straps. Comparable hardware can be seen in the bindings of Matthew Parker from the second half of the sixteenth century, now Corpus Christi College Cambridge SP.66, SP.57, and SP.244.The binding is recycled from a larger piece of punched leather, likely a sixteenth century panelled wall hanging or screen - although the dating of the punched pattern is much harder to determine. Similar designs are found on sixteenth century Italian wall hangings in the V&A Collection (items O304822, O304824, and O369581) which suggest a plausible place and date of origin.Although this leather was prevalent in luxury homes and churches from the sixteenth century, the practice of recycling leather wall hangings into book bindings is a rare phenomenon. A few examples can be found on printed books which were bound in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in Italy and Spain. The binding of MS Ashmole 46 represents one of the earliest known examples of this practice, and to date is the only known manuscript with this style of binding. It is also the only example identified thus far in England.The current binding is not the manuscript's original binding, as the text block has been trimmed and the page edges gilded at a later date after its production. This binding was likely made before 1588, as it does not match the style in which Sir Thomas Tresham, who owned the manuscript in 1588, bound his manuscripts with his family crest embossed in the centre of the front cover (see British Armorial Bindings, , stamps 1, 2, 3).

The tawed leather which covered the boards has been lifted and stored at the end of the separate fascicule of fragments.The former lower pastedowns are bound in at the end of the main text-block within its new binding, since they comprise the last two leaves of the final quire (XIII); they were lifted from the boards in 1988–9 and then foliated –. The inside front board must already have been bare in the 17th century, when a smaller piece of paper of that period was pasted directly onto the wood: it was lifted during conservation and is now stored at the front of the separate fascicule. The fascicule also contains a selection (those with fragments of redundant writing) of the original parchment strengtheners which had been used to line the folds at the inside and outside of each quire, some or all before the main writing-campaign; some of the other strengtheners (blank parchment, and/or written over in the main script) have been left in place in the text-block.308309",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Talbot states that Pontigny books were usually bound in thick wooden boards, which often split due to the manner of nailing studs into each cover (Talbot (see provenance), 110–11). During the 1820s there was a duty to be paid, by weight, on the import of all manuscripts written before 1801; the duty for bound books being higher than for unbound ones (see A. N. L. Munby, , III (Cambridge, 1954), 33), and it is therefore quite possible that Allard (see under Provenance) might have removed any heavy binding of no apparent interest, and then had the volume rebound inexpensively once in England.Phillipps Studies",,,,1900,1800,,,,,,,,,,

The chemise is lined with tawed skin, to which are sewn pink leather pouches to take the boards of the binding, which are white leather over wood. The boards sewn on seven thongs, as in Pollard’s Figures 4 and 5, s. xiv. Although the embroidered covering may be of Italian manufacture, the binding as a whole does not appear to have originated in Italy. Indeed, Frederick Bearman, ‘The Origins and Significance of Two Late Medieval Textile Chemise Bookbindings in the Walters Art Gallery’, , 54 (1996), 163–87 (166) proposes that it is ‘more appropriately understood as an English fifteenth-century(?) textile chemise binding, made of contemporary red velvet with embroidered decoration, possibly of Italian manufacture’. For a discussion of the binding in a wider context, see Jan Storm van Leeuwen, ‘The Well-Shirted Bookbinding. On chemise bindings and Hülleneinbände’ in T. Croiset van Uchelen et al., (Utrecht, 1989), 277–305 at 294 (no. 6).We have a vague for the binding, in as much as a note has been added at the top of the final flyleaf (‘nisi domine / illust[rissime] Reverendissime’; fol. 81) in a secretary script of the mid-fifteenth century. A further suggestion may be added: it may perhaps have been at the point of providing the chemise that pieces of thin material were stitched to the top of several folios, in order to protect the illumination; James records (xxxvii) six locations where these ‘(blue) silk guards’ remain (fol. 14, 27, 43, 46, 50, 59); on one other occasion, some of the thread remains (fol. 24), while in nine instances, the holes for the thread alone survive (fol. 1, 3, 4, 8, 18, 21, 37, 44, 51). On the practice of silk guards generally, see Christine Sciacca, ‘Raising the Curtain on the Use of Textiles in Manuscripts’ in Kathryn M.

The spine lining shows evidence of six raised sewing supports in the former binding. Six paper end leaves from this binding are still present in the manuscript. A note from Bruce Barker-Benfield on the final of these end leaves (foliated 119) records that . Barker-Benfield also conducted a collation survey of the manuscript after rebinding, now housed in the Bodley Refs, LVI.16. No other conservation records are preserved.thOne further flyleaf of this late 19 cent. paper after 119 was removed and destroyed in the rebinding of 1985thThe current binding (1985) comprises paper boards with external bevels covered in grey paper, with white leather spine lining. The spine shows four single raised sewing supports with projected spine tabs and sewn endbands in white thread. During the 1985 rebinding, paper sewing guards were added to the gutters of folios 9-10 and 21-22, and the gutters of folios 1-2, 5, were reinforced.Parchment sewing supports are preserved on folios 14-15, 25-26, 37-38, 56-57, 64-65, 72-73, 80-81, 88-89, 101-102, and 109-110.

Ryley comments that from the reader’s point of view, these reinforcing strips are 'narrow stubs poking out from between regular leaves' and that the 'stubby strips either lie flat, because they have been pasted on to adjacent leaves, or they stand up separately'. Ryley records strips at fols 6–7, 20–21, 34-35, 48–49, 62–63, 76–77, 90–91 and 103–04, with strips adhered to fols 90–91 ( [Boydell & Brewer, 2022], p. 75). Ryley cites as another example of reinforcing strips in a manuscript of Re-using Manuscripts in Late Medieval England: Repairing, Recycling, SharingMS. Rawl. poet. 163Troilus and CriseydeThese strips are made from what Ryley terms 'recycled material' and evidence of this is that they have traces of writing on them. Although the writing on the strips is barely legible, Ryley postulates that the strips are taken from a document of some sort, most likely from the 15th century; the date assigned by Ryley would make the recycyled document roughly contemporary with the manuscript itself. Ryley hazards that the strips on fols 14-15 may contain the name ‘John’ ( [Boydell & Brewer, 2022], p. 76)Re-using Manuscripts in Late Medieval England",,,true,,,219,219,219,149,149,149,,,,mm

Germ. e. 22,German,"Apparently the manuscript has only been bound once very shortly after it was finished, probably by a local Strasbourg bookbinder. Bound on three threads in brown calf leather; boards made from leather-covered wood and heavily decorated: plate stamp (negative plate) on the front board showing the crucifixion with inscription ‘PROPTER SCELVS POPVLI MEI’ [percussi eum, Jes. 53:8]; plate stamp (negative plate) on the lower board showing the resurrection with inscription ‘MORS ERO MORS TVA MORS’ [-us tuus ero, inferne, Hos. 13:14]. These stamps are identical with those found on the bindings of Munich, Bayrische Staatsbibliothek Inc.c.a. 77 a, an incunabulum which was rebound in 1586, and Vienna, Museum für angewandte Kunst–Barockbibliothek, S 25, which apparently was also written at St. Nikolaus in undis in the late 16th century and has a very similarly designed binding. Identification numbers of the plate stamps: EBDB p002705 and EBDB p002704; the connection of them to Konrad Haebler, (Leipzig, 1928–1929), I 378, X and the concluding ascription to a Nuremberg binder given in the EBDB prove to be false. Roll stamps around the centers of both front and back cover showing (1) symbols of the four evangelists, each of them with a book and surrounded by floral elements, (2) biblical quotes: ‘DATA EST MIHI OM’ [-nis potestas, Mt. 28:18], ‘TV ES PETRVS ET’ [super hanc petram aedificabo ecclesiam meam, Mt. 16:18], ‘ECCE AGNVS DEI’ [qui tollit peccatum, Joh. 1:29], ‘APPARVIT BENI’ [-gnitas et humanitas, Tit. 3:4], (3) apostles with their symbols: old man with two keys and a book, identifiable as Peter; man with sword and closed book, identifiable as Paul; man with a Cross, probably James; man with a book. Identical with a roll stamp found on the binding of Munich, Bayrische Staatsbibliothek, ESlg/J.can.p. 343, bearing the identification number EBDB r002888 and described in Konrad Haebler, (Leipzig, 1928–1929), II 229, 55.

Lincoln_College_MS_Lat_95_binding_1,manuscript_16035,Lincoln_College_MS_Lat_95,Lincoln College MS. Lat. 95,Lincoln College,"By , an early seventeenth-century binding of reverse calf over pulpboard. Decoration on both boards is restricted to a rectilinear pattern of intersecting lines. Three-line blind fillets to the edges crossing unmitred at the corners, repeated inset at 45 mm to produce a pattern of panels, a rough square at each corner and a central panel, unembellished. Sewn on four double thongs of tanned leather, raised at the spine. Endbands of white thread are non-structural. Paired fore-edge ties of green cord are cut away flush to the boards. Fore-edges are sprinkled red. Marks of the usual college chain clip are at the fore-edge of the back board towards the foot, with verdigris inside. The joint has split entirely on the top board and is half split on the lower; but the condition otherwise is very good. Flyleaves of tough medieval parchment, contemporary with the text-block: the front pastedown is lifted; the rear pastedown is partly loose at the top corner and has been cut away at the bottom corner where the brass chain-clip was. Wormholes relating to an earlier binding extend through the first sixteen leaves and the last seven. Roger Barnes of Oxford",,,,1625,1600,,,,,,,,,,
